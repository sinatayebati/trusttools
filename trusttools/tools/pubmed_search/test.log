[{'title': 'An Evaluation of NIOSH-Funded Centers and Their Response Activities Through the COVID-19 Pandemic: March 2020 to July 2021.', 'abstract': 'During the COVID-19 pandemic, workplaces served as an important nexus of disease transmission, increasing the need for evidence-based guidance in occupational safety and health. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is responsible for developing such evidence, and funds extramural centers for education, training and research. Using the results of a survey and key informant interviews, we document the impact of research and outreach collaborations by the centers during the pandemic. From 26 surveys and 9 interviews, several themes emerged. Through established partnerships, experts from the NIOSH-funded Centers translated and operationalized information from agencies for local businesses and workers; provided timely technical assistance and outreach; and engaged in research to study health impacts of COVID-19 on diverse worker populations. Overall, the NIOSH-funded centers and programs played an important role in providing critically needed occupational health and safety services to regional stakeholders during the pandemic. Continuing to develop intramural-extramural partnerships to be responsive during a public health emergency will allow these Centers to serve as local or regional subject matter experts, gather real-time data during an emergency event, and aid in the overall response for subsequent public health emergencies.', 'keywords': ['COVID-19 response', 'NIOSH', 'evaluation', 'extramural centers', 'occupational safety and health'], 'url': 'https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40177916'}, {'title': 'Workplace Challenges and Support Needs Experienced by Nurse Leaders in Home and Community Care During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Qualitative Study.', 'abstract': 'The COVID-19 pandemic had unprecedented impacts on the wellbeing of home care workers. Responsive leadership is a key facilitator for positive perceptions of work and reduced turnover intentions. Yet, the impact of the pandemic on nurse leaders working in home and community care remains to be explored. To describe the workplace experiences of point-of-care nurse leaders in the home and community care sector in Ontario, Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 8 nurse leaders in home care and analyzed thematically. Four overarching themes developed: (1) Inspired to lead-participants sought leadership roles to amplify their impact on client care, provider experience and the healthcare system. (2) Pandemic leadership challenges-leaders struggled to adapt to new pandemic-related workload demands, including unprecedented needs for staff well-being support. (3) Strategies to improve well-being-the personal toll of the pandemic was mitigated for some by maintaining personal boundaries and by strong support from peers and senior leaders. (4) Lessons learned-leaders expressed pride in their pandemic responses and professional growth through this time. They identified opportunities for stronger workplace structures to support them to excel in their roles. These experiences highlight the opportunity to better support nurse leaders in home and community care settings by creating work structures which promote healthy workplace boundaries, enable connections, and facilitate peer-to-peer information sharing. Such structures can support nurse leaders to thrive in their roles and continue to act as vital sources of support to their teams.', 'keywords': ['COVID-19', 'home care', 'nurse leaders', 'occupational health', 'workplace support'], 'url': 'https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40162650'}, {'title': 'Working from home and well-being during the pandemic and beyond: a longitudinal analysis in five countries.', 'abstract': 'BACKGROUND: Given the rise of remote work in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, many studies have investigated how working from home (WFH) is related to employee well-being. So far, findings have been mixed and based predominantly on cross-sectional analyses.\nMETHODS: We used multi-level regression models to describe the longitudinal relationship between WFH and well-being over 11 assessments from April 2020 to November 2023, based on a unique, population-based sample of N\u2009=\u20093403 employed participants from five European countries.\nRESULTS: Even after controlling for relevant covariates, WFH was negatively related to well-being in the initial stages of the pandemic, but unrelated to WFH thereafter.\nCONCLUSION: Our analysis offers a differentiated picture on within- and between-person dynamics of WFH and well-being over the course of the pandemic and beyond and can inform the discussion how individuals, organizations, and societies can prepare for a future in which WFH plays a more prominent role.', 'keywords': ['COVID-19', 'Longitudinal studies', 'Occupational health', 'Well-being', 'Working from home'], 'url': 'https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40155943'}, {'title': 'The Economic and Occupational Impact of Mental Health-Related Temporary Work Disabilities in Spanish Workers During and After the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Longitudinal Study.', 'abstract': 'BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected mental health worldwide, exposing gaps in managing work-related disabilities. In Spain, Mutual Collaborators with Social Security play a pivotal role in managing temporary work disabilities associated with mental health conditions.\nOBJECTIVES: This study aimed to describe and analyze the prevalence, characteristics, and economic burden of mental health-related temporary work disabilities in Spain during the COVID-19 pandemic and recovery (2020-2022).\nMETHODS: A prospective longitudinal design was used, drawing on data from CHAMAN, a secure and nationally representative database managed by Asepeyo Mutual Insurance and maintained by Mutual Collaborators with Social Security (MCSSs). The study included workers who experienced temporary work disabilities due to mental health disorders diagnosed according to the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, during the COVID-19 state of alarm (14 March-21 June 2020) and in the following two years (2021-2022). The key variables were demographics, absence duration, cost per case, and relapse rates. The analyses included descriptive statistics and the Mann-Whitney U, Chi-square, and logistic regression tests.\nRESULTS: In 2020, 5135 cases were recorded, with an aggregate cost of approximately EUR 44.8 million. Regional analysis showed that Catalonia, Castile-La Mancha, and Castile-Le√≥n accounted for over half the expenditure, whereas costs were lower in other regions. Marked declines in incidence and costs were observed in 2021-2022, suggesting adaptation to post-pandemic conditions. However, significant gender disparities persisted, with women experiencing higher relapse rates and prolonged absences. Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Major Depressive Disorder were the most common diagnoses, particularly in sectors such as retail, elderly care, and call centers.\nCONCLUSIONS: Although the incidence and cost of temporary work disabilities declined, persistent gender inequalities, regional disparities, and sector-specific risks highlight the need for targeted mental health interventions. Enhancing psychosocial support, adopting gender-sensitive workplace policies, and improving regional healthcare infrastructure are essential to promote workforce well-being and ensure economic sustainability.', 'keywords': ['COVID-19', 'anxiety disorders', 'mental health', 'occupational health', 'temporary work disability'], 'url': 'https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40150468'}, {'title': 'What can be learned from the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on work participation among people with work disabilities? A qualitative practice & policy perspective approach.', 'abstract': "BACKGROUND: Previous studies among people with work disabilities (WD) showed that during the COVID-19 pandemic they were at risk for negative outcomes on work participation and health. These studies focused on people's own accounts of their difficulties to work and did not include the policy and practice perspective. The aim of the present study was to explore the policy and practice perspective on what can be learned from the impact of the COVID-19 crisis, and what is needed to enhance work participation among people with WD, in times of crisis and beyond.\nMETHODS: We used a multi-stakeholder perspective qualitative approach. Between March 2021 and September 2022, twenty-five semi-structured in-depth online interviews were conducted with occupational health professionals (13), employers (7) and policymakers (5). Participants were asked to share their experiences about employees or job seekers with work disabilities on (re)gaining and maintaining paid employment, barriers and facilitators for work participation during the Covid-19 crisis and what is needed to enhance work participation among people with WD in times of crisis and beyond. Data were analysed using thematic content analysis.\nRESULTS: The results indicated that, although employers rapidly implemented new working arrangements, people with WD had a vulnerable labour market position during the COVID-19 crisis, especially those with temporary contracts. Job loss and detrimental effects on mental health were identified. Other barriers to work participation included hampered collaboration between stakeholders during lockdowns and fewer job opportunities due to workplace shutdowns. Nevertheless, employers and occupational health professionals noticed that some employees were surprisingly flexible and capable with regard to performing alternative work tasks. We also identified ways to improve work participation for people with WD, including simplifying legislation and establishing sustainable policies on employment, investing in career development, creating an inclusive organizational culture and increasing accessibility to information and support assistance.\nCONCLUSIONS: People with WD had a vulnerable labour market position during the COVID-19 crisis. The introduction of new working arrangements became widespread during the COVID-19 crisis, which had both positive and negative consequences for people with WD. Our results showed that improving work participation for people with WD requires a multifaceted approach, which can be achieved by the practical and policy recommendations offered by this study.", 'keywords': ['COVID-19 pandemic', 'Disability', 'Employment', 'Needs', 'Occupational health services', 'Qualitative study'], 'url': 'https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40148811'}, {'title': 'Exploring Well-Being Disparities: A Comparative Analysis of Urban and Rural Clinicians Using the NIOSH Worker Well-Being Questionnaire.', 'abstract': 'BACKGROUND: Clinician well-being is crucial to the healthcare system, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, which intensified psychological distress among clinicians. This study examines well-being disparities between rural and urban clinicians using the NIOSH Worker Well-Being Questionnaire (WellBQ).\nMETHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 222 clinicians from one urban and three rural hospitals in North Carolina between September and December 2022. The WellBQ assessed well-being across five domains. Data analysis identified concerning thresholds based on positive and negative responses, with discrepancies resolved through independent reviews and focus group validation.\nFINDINGS: In the work evaluation and experience domain, rural hospitals reported concerns with time paucity and work overload, while urban hospitals focused on work-related fatigue and job engagement. Rural hospitals noted issues with job benefits, health programs, and schedule flexibility, whereas urban hospitals emphasized the lack of supportive work culture and management trust. Both settings reported concerns in the physical environment and safety climate domain, including sexual harassment, physical violence, and bullying. Health status concerns in rural hospitals included overall stress and poor mental health, while urban hospitals highlighted chronic health conditions and risky drinking.\nCONCLUSION: This study identified significant well-being disparities between rural and urban clinicians, with urban hospitals showing higher concerning thresholds. Future research should refine these thresholds, explore workplace violence causes, and assess long-term impacts on clinician well-being.Applications to Practice:This study reveals significant well-being disparities between rural and urban clinicians, emphasizing the need for tailored occupational health interventions.', 'keywords': ['The NIOSH WellBQ', 'clinicians', 'thresholds', 'well-being'], 'url': 'https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40099543'}, {'title': 'Women of Color and Intersectionality Initiative: A Workgroup Report on the Continued Need to Support and Retain Women of Color.', 'abstract': 'Background: Unprecedented stressors have significantly impacted our nation. These occurrences compounded the prepandemic structural factors that disproportionately affect historically, economically, and socially marginalized communities of color and women as highlighted by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. In response, health care organizations and regulatory bodies have shifted from the quadruple aim to the quintuple aim to conceptualize health care improvement by adding to the prioritizing of the health workforce\'s well-being and advancing health equity (Nundy, Cooper, &amp; Mate, 2022). The literature presents limited and conflicting information regarding workforce well-being based on demographic background. A 2021 report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine described the potential for race, ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, and disability status to alter or amplify the career impacts of COVID-19 (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, 2021). Methods: In 2020, the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) convened a Women of Color and Intersectionality Initiative ("Initiative") to understand better and address factors contributing to the well-being challenges encountered in health systems by women of color (WOC). Results: Based on a rigorous review of existing data and national trends, the group concluded that WOC continue to exist and work at the margins and that the threat of "not belonging" is a key factor impacting their well-being. The authors, who are members of this AAMC WOC Intersectionality Initiative, identified key strategies in the domains of intersectionality and equity, work-life boundaries, gendered divisions of labor, and mental health and well-being for implementation and evaluation in future studies. Conclusion: Over the last 4 years, the health and scientific workforces have encountered staffing shortages, increased attrition rates, and an overall decline of wellness. Authors and thought leaders in this space have postulated the need to refine tools and methodologies to capture intersectional differences to inform strategy. This article presents recommendations from the Initiative that include solutions that prioritize intersectionality, which can be adopted by academic health systems to support the well-being of WOC.', 'keywords': ['academic medicine', 'occupational health', 'women of color'], 'url': 'https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40098533'}, {'title': 'Factors Associated with Working During the COVID-19 Pandemic and Intent to Stay at Current Nursing Position.', 'abstract': "The pandemic exacerbated job stress and burnout among nurses, increasing turnover and intentions to leave, in a workforce struggling with severe shortages. Shortages and turnover are associated with decreased quality of care, poor nurse health, and increased costs. This article reports the findings of a study that sought to identify characteristics of the job, work environment, and psychosocial health outcomes that may predict nurses' intent to stay at their current nursing position within the next year. Utilizing a cross-sectional design, we electronically surveyed working nurses (n = 629) during the summer of 2020 across 36 states. Demographics, work characteristics, and validated measures of anxiety, insomnia, and depressive symptoms were assessed. Logistic regression models identified factors associated with nurses' intent to stay at their jobs. Colleague support, organizational support, and organizational pandemic preparedness were associated with increased odds of intent to stay, while both mild and moderate/severe depressive symptoms were associated with decreased odds of intent to stay. Because over a quarter of nurses surveyed reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms, which were strongly associated with turnover intention, organizational leadership should examine mental health resources available to nurses and work characteristics that could be contributing to nurses' poor psychosocial health. Additionally, further research is needed to assess the meaning of organizational support to nurses in a post-COVID-19 context, as well how to create a work environment in which nurses are able to provide support to their colleagues.", 'keywords': ['COVID-19', 'Nursing', 'conceptual models', 'intent to stay', 'mental health', 'mixed methods design', 'nurses', 'occupational health', 'turnover', 'turnover intention', 'work environment'], 'url': 'https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40093384'}, {'title': 'Computer vision syndrome: a comprehensive literature review.', 'abstract': 'Computer Vision Syndrome is a growing health concern in the digital age, with a reported prevalence of 69.0%.
