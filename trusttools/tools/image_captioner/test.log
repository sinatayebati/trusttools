For precise descriptions, consider: using it with other tools for context/verification, as an initial step before refinement, or in multi-step processes for ambiguity resolution.

Generated Caption:
The image features four blue buckets, each filled with baseballs. 

1. **Top Row**: 
   - The first bucket on the left is empty, showcasing its blue interior.
   - The second bucket contains several baseballs, with their distinctive white color and red stitching visible.

2. **Middle Row**: 
   - The third bucket also holds a similar number of baseballs, arranged in a way that some are partially obscured by others.
   - The fourth bucket mirrors the third, filled with baseballs, maintaining the same visual style.

All buckets have a simple design with handles on either side, and the baseballs are depicted in a realistic manner, emphasizing their round shape and stitching details. The overall composition is clean and straightforward, focusing on the buckets and their contents.
Done!
